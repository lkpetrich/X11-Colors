About the Source Code for X11 Colors


This application is for anyone who wants to use color names instead of numerical values in X-windows apps and web development. Names like "LightSeaGreen" rather than "#20B2AA" or "rgb(32,178,170)".

You select a color by clicking on the color swatch on top, and it will sort the color list into order, from closest to farthest. You can select a color to copy out; the selection's name, red value, green value, blue value, combined hexadecimal value, and combine decimal value will appear just above the table. The separate red, green, and blue values are all decimal ones: 0 to 255. You can also sort the list with the color that you have selected.

For its color names and values, X11 Colors uses file "rgb.txt" that came in an X-windows distribution.

In MacOS X, this file is at /usr/X11/share/X11/rgb.txt


This source code includes an Xcode project file, and it is for building in Xcode for recent versions of MacOS X. It also contains a Python/TK version in directory "Python-TK". Feel free to build versions for other operating systems and GUI toolkits.

To run the Python/TK version, run "ShowColors.py" on the command line. Files "X11Colors.py" and "rgb.txt" must be in the same directory. "X11Colors.py" reads and interprets "rgb.txt".
